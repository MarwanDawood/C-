%% Introduction
% 
% Raspberry Pi is a single board, credit-card size computer that can run
% Linux(R). Raspberry Pi hardware has low-level interfaces intended to
% connect directly with external devices such as A/D converters, sensors,
% motor drivers, etc. You can take advantage of these low-level interfaces
% to develop meaningful real-world applications. The Raspberry Pi support
% package includes MATLAB command-line interfaces to communicate with
% external devices connected to Raspberry Pi hardware. You can, for
% example, turn a LED connected to one of the GPIO pins on or off or sense
% the position of a push button from the MATLAB command prompt.
%
% Most of the low-level interfaces of Raspberry Pi hardware are not
% plug-and-play. To use these low-level interfaces, you must have a sound
% understanding of basic electrical concepts. If you mis-wire a GPIO pin,
% for example, you risk losing a GPIO pin, and, in some cases, your
% Raspberry Pi hardware.
%
% This example is intended to familiarize you with low level interfaces
% of the Raspberry Pi hardware, establish sound practices for wiring and
% connections when working with external electrical components and use
% MATLAB command-line interface for Raspberry Pi hardware to control simple
% devices like LEDs, push buttons, and relays.


%% Prerequisites
%
% * It is helpful to complete the
% <docid:raspberrypiio_ref.example-raspi_gettingstarted Getting Started with MATLAB Support Package for Raspberry Pi Hardware>
% example.

%% Required Hardware
% 
% To run this example, you need the following hardware:
% 
% * Raspberry Pi hardware
% * A power supply with at least 1A output
% * Breadboard and jumper cables
% * Red LED
% * 330 Ohm, 1 kOhm and 10 kOhm resistors
% * A push button or switch

 
%% Overview of Raspberry Pi Hardware
%
% In addition to USB, Ethernet, HDMI, and Audio Out ports, the Raspberry Pi
% hardware has expansion headers that offer general purpose digital I/O,
% SPI, I2C, and serial UART. Depending on the revision of your Raspberry Pi
% hardware, the available digital I/O pins, pin-outs for I2C, SPI, and
% serial ports change.
% 
% All versions of the Raspberry Pi hardware have one or more expansion
% headers. You can use some of the pins on the expansion headers for
% digital I/O. To see a diagram of the pins of your Raspberry Pi hardware,
% use showPins() method of raspi object.
%
%   rpi = raspi();
%   showPins(rpi);
%
% The showPins() method displays a MATLAB figure showing a diagram of pins
% available. The raspi object determines the version number of your
% Raspberry Pi hardware and displays the correct pin diagram for your
% version of the board. Raspberry Pi Model B+ board has more I/O pins
% exposed than Raspberry Pi Model B board.
% 
% The GPIO pins use 3.3 volt logic levels and are not 5 volt tolerant.
% There is no over-voltage protection on the CPU chip. A CSI (camera serial
% interface) is available so that you can connect an available Camera
% Board. You can use some of the pins available on the Raspberry Pi
% hardware for multiple purposes. For example, if you do not need to use
% SPI interface, you can use SPI pins as general purpose digital I/O. The
% pins marked as SDA0 and SCL0 are preset to be used as an I2C interface.
% There are 1.8 kOhm pull-up resistors on the board for these pins.
%
% You can power external components using 3.3 volt and 5 volt power pins on
% the expansion headers. The maximum permitted current draw from the 3.3
% volt pins is 50 mA.
 
%% Best Practices and Restrictions
%
% * Do not connect electrical components to Raspberry Pi expansion headers
% while Raspberry Pi hardware is running. If you want to connect an
% electrical component, turn off your board first. Instructions for
% turning off you board are provided below.
%
% * Raspberry Pi pins use 3.3 volt logic levels. Do not connect devices
% using 5 volt logic levels directly to the Raspberry Pi pins.
%
% * Use logic level converters when interfacing devices using 5 volt logic
% levels to Raspberry Pi hardware.
% 
% * Do not short a GPIO pin configured as digital output.
%
% * Do not short 5 volt power pins to any other pin on the expansion
% header. Be extremely careful when working in the vicinity of 5 volt power
% pins.
% 
% * Do not touch bare expansion header pins while Raspberry Pi hardware is
% on. You can accidentally short some of the pins.

%% Turning Your Raspberry Pi Hardware On and Off
% 
% Raspberry Pi runs a Linux operating system. Turning off the power can
% result in corrupting the operating system image on the SD card. To turn
% off your board, first shut down the Linux operating system by executing
% the following:
%
%   system(rpi, 'sudo shutdown -h now');
%   clear rpi
%
% You can also execute the preceding command above on an interactive
% command shell as described in the Getting Started with MATLAB Support
% Package for Raspberry Pi Hardware example. To turn off your board in
% MATLAB Online, you must execute the following Linux command from the
% command shell on the Raspberry Pi. Access the command shell remotely via
% SSH with PuTTY, as described in
% <matlab:web('https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/','-browser')
% Remote Access>.
%
%   $sudo shutdown -h now
%
% After executing the command, wait until the operating system shuts down
% all LEDs on the board except for PWR LED. Then, unplug the power cable
% from the board. To restart your board, plug the power cable back into the
% board. It takes approximately a minute for the board to fully reboot.

%% Working with LEDs
%
% A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source. An LED has
% two legs. One is called anode and the other is called cathode. The
% two legs of LED have different names because LED works only in one
% direction. The anode leg is longer than the cathode leg, and must be
% attached to the positive voltage terminal while the cathode is attached
% to the negative voltage terminal. The current going through an LED goes
% from anode to cathode. If you wire an LED backwards, it does not light
% up. 
%
% LEDs come in different colors and sizes. Common sizes are 3mm, 5mm and
% 10mm and refer to the diameter of the LED. A red LED, when it is on will
% have a forward voltage anywhere from 1.8 volts to 2.5 volts. When a LED
% is on, it behaves like a diode and passes a large amount of current that
% may produce enough heat to cause the LED to burn out. Therefore, you
% should always use a current-limiting resistor when working with an LED.
% 
% In this example, you connect a red LED across a GPIO pin and turn the LED
% on and off using the MATLAB command-line interface. You need a red LED
% and a 330 Ohm resistor. You connect the LED and the resistor as shown in
% the circuit diagram.
%
% <<../led_circuit_diagram.png>>
%
% Here is another view showing the actual connections on a breadboard.
%
% <<../led_breadboard_diagram.png>>
%
% The anode (positive or long leg) is connected to the GPIO24 pin and the
% cathode is connected to the ground through the resistor. Once you make
% the connections, execute the following command at the MATLAB command
% prompt to turn the LED on.
%  
%   clear rpi
%   rpi = raspi();
%   writeDigitalPin(rpi, 24, 1);
%
% The writeDigitalPin() method configures GPIO pin 24 as output and sets
% the logical value of the digital pin to one (logic high) causing 3.3
% volts to be output at the pin. Writing a zero to a digital pin results in
% an output of logic low, which is digital ground in this case.
%
% Make the LED "blink" for 10 seconds.
%  
%   for i = 1:10
%       writeDigitalPin(rpi, 24, 1);
%       pause(0.5);
%       writeDigitalPin(rpi, 24, 0);
%       pause(0.5);
%   end
%  

%% Working with Pushbuttons
%
% A push button is a simple switch mechanism. When pressed or in closed
% position, the legs of a push button are shorted allowing electrical
% current to pass. When in open position, the switch does not conduct
% electricity. You can use a digital input pin to sense if the push button
% is in an open or closed position.
% 
% For this task, you need a breadboard-friendly pushbutton and 1 kOhm and
% 10 kOhm resistors. Connect the push button to GPIO pin 23, as shown in
% the following circuit diagram.
%
% <<../pushbutton_circuit_diagram.png>>
%
% In this circuit, the GPIO pin sees ground when the push button is not
% pressed. When the pushbutton is pressed, the GPIO pin sees 3.3 volts. You
% can read the position of the push-button using the readDigitalPin()
% method.
%  
%  readDigitalPin(rpi, 23)
%  

%% Push button Controlled LED
%
% Blink the LED rapidly for 1 second whenever the push button is pressed.
%  
%   for i = 1:100
